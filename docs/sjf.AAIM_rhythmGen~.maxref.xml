			<description>Send a pair of values to set the probability for a specific rhythmic variation of the underlying pulse. ioiProb division probability (e.g. [ioiProb 0.5 1] would set the chance of half the normal rate to be triggered to 1; [ioiProb 1.5 0.2] would set the chance of a dotted note equal to 1.5 times the normal rate to be triggered to 0.2. </description>

		<method name='nBeats'>
			<digest>This sets the number of beats in the rhythmic pattern, this defaults to 8</digest>
